==== before 1.0 release:

1. table loading. with pageable or wait for infinite scrolling fix. because i need load and reload every page, i need it
then i move down and up again, reload previously loaded data
2. add/delete/update should trigger page refresh, not manipulating with data array
3. calculater should get numbers from field and put result in selected field. like several calculator buttons on every field
there it needed, it's only 2 fields, and when you click 'done' it sets result to this field
4. generate pdf report so you can print it or save
5. think about new reports:
    * information about sum of all incomes (separated by currency of course) and sum of all expenses. May be with possibility
      to remove operation type from calculation
